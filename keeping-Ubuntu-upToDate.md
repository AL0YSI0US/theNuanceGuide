### Check your Version Of Git

````bash
// The command to run:
git --version 

// Desired Result:
git version 2.25.1

If you don't see a supported version of Git, you'll need to either upgrade Git or you will need to do a fresh install, as described below.

````bash
sudo apt-get install git
````

## Update your terminal

````bash
sudo apt update
````

ðŸ”“ You will be prompted to enter your password in order to continue.

In order to see the upgrades available to you, type the following into the command line:

````bash
apt list --upgradable
````
